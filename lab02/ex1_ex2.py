	Ex1:
The task is to implement a function that calculates the maximum flow and compares the time when using BFS and when using DFS.
    Ex2:
However, for the second task, it is necessary to calculate the edge cohesion, this can be done in such a way that
    we will treat each edge as if it had edge equal to 1, and then calculate the number of edge-disjoint paths for each pair of vertices
    and we will choose a pair for which it will be as small as possible and this will be our edge cohesion - but unfortunately the complexity
    There are many such ideas, although they are still polynomial
